This has to end before it gets out of control&nbsp;... there's much more at stake here than you think!</p></div><div class="dialog cain"><tt>tower_003</tt><p><b>cain:</b> Ravenhollow is just the beginning.</p></div><div class="dialog cain"><tt>tower_004</tt><p><b>cain:</b> With the help of the technology that I have collected from the Smith Institute, I will be able to expand my sphere of control&nbsp;... village by village, city by city.</p></div><div class="dialog nigel"><tt>tower_005</tt><p><b>nigel:</b> Control? Is that what you call opening people's mail, stealing their hard work, and dominating their lives?</p></div><div class="dialog cain"><tt>tower_006</tt><p><b>cain:</b> Nigel Trelawney. I see you found a way into the Castle after all. </p></div><div class="dialog cain"><tt>tower_007</tt><p><b>cain:</b> You've probably already met Baron Northwest himself&nbsp;... and you brought a friend?</p></div><div class="dialog nathan"><tt>tower_008</tt><p><b>nathan:</b> Dr. Coppelius, are you alright?</p></div><div class="dialog coppelius"><tt>tower_009</tt><p><b>coppelius:</b> I'm quite alright lad, but I'm afraid that could change very soon. Even Mr. Cain clearly underestimates the forces at work here.</p></div><div class="dialog nigel"><tt>tower_010</tt><p><b>nigel:</b> Hey, you're the girl from the boathouse! How about you give me back my photograph?</p></div><div class="dialog nora"><tt>tower_011</tt><p><b>nora:</b> What? Who are you and what are you talking about?</p></div><div class="dialog nora"><tt>tower_012</tt><p><b>nora:</b> Nathan!

I'm sorry we dragged you into this again, Nathan.</p></div><div class="dialog vincent"><tt>tower_016</tt><p><b>vincent:</b> Nathan and Nigel. Nigel and Nathan. You two are remarkable!</p></div><div class="dialog nigel"><tt>tower_017</tt><p><b>nigel:</b> Who are you?</p></div><div class="dialog vincent"><tt>tower_018</tt><p><b>vincent:</b> I am the one who marvels at how such pathetic and sorry characters as yourselves can still manage to turn up right on schedule.</p></div><div class="dialog vincent"><tt>tower_019</tt><p><b>vincent:</b> I'm sure my dear old colleagues would agree that the two of you are just like clockwork&nbsp;...</p></div><div class="dialog vincent"><tt>tower_020</tt><p><b>vincent:</b> A "Tick" will surely always be followed by a "Tock", and stupidity such as yours will always play into my hands.</p></div><div class="dialog coppelius"><tt>tower_021</tt><p><b>coppelius:</b> That is perhaps the most scientifically deep sentence I've ever heard from you.</p></div><div class="dialog coppelius"><tt>tower_022</tt><p><b>coppelius:</b> And I suppose your lackluster science is why you have to steal your colleagues' inventions instead of developing your own. Vincent Goodchild.</p></div><div class="dialog cain"><tt>tower_023</tt><p><b>cain:</b> Enough.</p></div><div class="dialog cain"><tt>tower_024</tt><p><b>cain:</b> Why are you jeopardizing our plan by letting these two fools sneak into the castle behind our backs, Goodchild?</p></div><div class="dialog cain"><tt>tower_025</tt><p><b>cain:</b> Now is not the time to get careless. We've stolen the zeppelin and are ready to put our next phase into operation!</p></div><div class="dialog vincent"><tt>tower_026</tt><p><b>vincent:</b> There is no next phase in "our" plan, Cain&nbsp;... your role is finished.</p></div><div class="dialog cain"><tt>tower_027</tt><p><b>cain:</b> What are you talking about? Are you questioning the quality of my work here in Ravenhollow? </p></div><div class="dialog cain"><tt>tower_028</tt><p><b>cain:</b> I did my part by protecting you under the scientists' blade during the surgery.</p></div><div class="dialog vincent"><tt>tower_029</tt><p><b>vincent:</b> Indeed, you've done quite well.</p></div><div class="dialog vincent"><tt>tower_030</tt><p><b>vincent:</b> But your arrogance fails to recall that your source of power within Ravenhollow relies on the invention that I gave you.</p></div><div class="dialog cain"><tt>tower_031</tt><p><b>cain:</b> Yes, your brain washing devices were quite helpful; but you clearly still overrate your role here, Goodchild.  You still need me to put your colleagues' inventions to use.</p></div><div class="dialog cain"><tt>tower_032</tt><p><b>cain:</b> You need someone who knows how to lead and how to make decisions. I think it's time for you to make amends for your lack of respect!</p></div><div class="dialog cain"><tt>tower_033</tt><p><b>cain:</b> Castle guards? Arrest this man! I no longer need him!</p></div><div class="dialog smith"><tt>tower_034</tt><p><b>smith:</b> Watch out! Vincent is wearing a strength&#8212;enhancing suit like the one we developed for Professor Von Sternberg&nbsp;...</p></div><div class="dialog coppelius"><tt>tower_035</tt><p><b>coppelius:</b> â€¦ and the heart that we implanted in him will quadruple its power.</p></div><div class="dialog nathan"><tt>tower_036</tt><p><b>nathan:</b> The heart? Uh oh&nbsp;...</p></div><div class="dialog nora"><tt>tower_037</tt><p><b>nora:</b> Yes, Vincent forced my grandfather and Professor Smith to copy my mechanical heart and then to implant it in his chest.</p></div><div class="dialog nora"><tt>tower_038</tt><p><b>nora:</b> They did it to save me from Lowell Cain, who held me hostage until Vincent made it safely through the surgery.</p></div><div class="dialog vincent"><tt>tower_039</tt><p><b>vincent:</b> And you made a fine insurance policy, my dear. Heaven forbid that your grandfather's blade would have accidentally "slipped" during the surgery.</p></div><div class="dialog cain"><tt>tower_040</tt><p><b>cain:</b> Enough! Guards, they exaggerate his strength. You can easily overpower him!</p></div><div class="dialog cain"><tt>tower_041</tt><p><b>cain:</b> But what about the plan? Ravenhollow was only supposed to be the beginning!</p></div><div class="dialog vincent"><tt>tower_042</tt><p><b>vincent:</b> Ravenhollow IS only the beginning, you fool!</p></div><div class="dialog vincent"><tt>tower_043</tt><p><b>vincent:</b> I promised you a leading role in my plans, and you've played your part. I have only one thing left in store for you, Cain&nbsp;... removal.</p></div><div class="dialog vincent"><tt>tower_044</tt><p><b>vincent:</b> And now I will fulfill another promise that I made to you, Professor Smith, so many years ago&nbsp;...</p></div><div class="dialog vincent"><tt>tower_045</tt><p><b>vincent:</b> I will get my hands on the raw power of your inventions. ALL of them.</p></div><div class="dialog smith"><tt>tower_046</tt><p><b>smith:</b> You know it's too late for that, Vincent. They're all gone!</p></div><div class="dialog vincent"><tt>tower_047</tt><p><b>vincent:</b> Ha! You continue to make the mistake of assuming that your research can be hidden from me.</p></div><div class="dialog coppelius"><tt>tower_048</tt><p><b>coppelius:</b> Give it up, Vincent. What Smith says is true.</p></div><div class="dialog coppelius"><tt>tower_049</tt><p><b>coppelius:</b> We destroyed our research and inventions right after the Institute was closed.</p></div><div class="dialog coppelius"><tt>tower_050</tt><p><b>coppelius:</b> We knew that we couldn't let them fall into your hands. Your plan to recover our work failed years ago.</p></div><div class="dialog vincent"><tt>tower_051</tt><p><b>vincent:</b> Like the prototype that survived in your granddaughter's chest, Coppelius? And that was just the first of many inventions that I will use to bring the world to its knees.</p></div><div class="dialog vincent"><tt>tower_052</tt><p><b>vincent:</b> You old fools forget that it would take only one device to crumble your efforts to hide your research from me.</p></div><div class="dialog vincent"><tt>tower_053</tt><p><b>vincent:</b> And now that storms rage again at the top of Mount Misery I would say that the doorway has been reopened to the power and brilliance of The Nine.</p></div><div class="dialog vincent"><tt>tower_054</tt><p><b>vincent:</b> And according to my&#8212;albeit rough and clumsy&#8212;calculations, this mechanical heart and suit should give me more than enough strength to conduct the forbidden experiment.</p></div><div class="dialog vincent"><tt>tower_055</tt><p><b>vincent:</b> Gentlemen, I'll see you on the other side of&nbsp;... The Apparatus.</p></div><div class="dialog coppelius"><tt>tower_056</tt><p><b>coppelius:</b> No! You can't do that! You wouldn't dare!</p></div><div class="dialog smith"><tt>tower_057</tt><p><b>smith:</b> The construction of that apparatus was a mistake to begin with!</p></div><div class="dialog vincent"><tt>tower_058</tt><p><b>vincent:</b> Now there's just one thing missing&nbsp;... Nigel Trelawney?</p></div><div class="dialog vincent"><tt>tower_059</tt><p><b>vincent:</b> I believe you carry the keys to this operation&nbsp;... both in your mind and in your pocket. I asked you to recover the nine insignia rings of the founding members of the Smith Institute?</p></div><div class="dialog nigel"><tt>tower_060</tt><p><b>nigel:</b> What? Oh, but of course! It wasn't the Baron who required those insignia seals on my heritage certificate, it was you all along!</p></div><div class="dialog vincent"><tt>tower_061</tt><p><b>vincent:</b> How astute; straight A's for you, Nigel. Of course, I would have expected nothing less from Anthony Trelawney's son.</p></div><div class="dialog smith"><tt>tower_062</tt><p><b>smith:</b> Don't give him those insignia rings!</p></div><div class="dialog coppelius"><tt>tower_063</tt><p><b>coppelius:</b> Get out of here, Nigel! You mustn't let him take them from you!</p></div><div class="dialog vincent"><tt>tower_064</tt><p><b>vincent:</b> 900 times 25.003&nbsp;...</p></div><div class="dialog nigel"><tt>tower_065</tt><p><b>nigel:</b> 22502.7 but&nbsp;...</p></div><div class="dialog vincent"><tt>tower_066</tt><p><b>vincent:</b> Pi divided by 3.51876&nbsp;...</p></div><div class="dialog nigel"><tt>tower_067</tt><p><b>nigel:</b> 0,89281242642004377634810086032551&nbsp;...</p></div><div class="dialog vincent"><tt>tower_068</tt><p><b>vincent:</b> You really are your father's son&nbsp;... old Trelawney couldn't control it either&nbsp;...</p></div><div class="dialog nathan"><tt>tower_069</tt><p><b>nathan:</b> Nigel, watch out!!</p></div><div class="dialog smith"><tt>tower_070</tt><p><b>smith:</b> Be careful!</p></div><div class="dialog vincent"><tt>tower_071</tt><p><b>vincent:</b> I fear I will need your help too, Professor Smith!
