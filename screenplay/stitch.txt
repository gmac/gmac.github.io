INTRODUCTION

Hello, and thanks for checking out our project! We're Lassie Games, a three-man independent production studio that makes classic graphic adventure games (think Monkey Island or the King's Quest series). Our best-known titles are the "What Makes You Tick?" games, the first of which you can play for free online at http://lassiegames.com/games/wmyt

We recently recorded the original "What Makes You Tick?" game with a cast of local actors, and we love the life that the acting brings to the story. It also proved that our old Flash engine is indeed capable of handling voiceover dialog. So, we're tentatively exploring recording the sequel, "A Stitch in Time", which you can learn more about at http://lassiegames.com/stitch. Unfortunately, Stitch is HUGE, so we're going to need lots of additional acting talent if we're going to pull it off.

We're an independent studio doing this as our hobby, and we donate the proceeds of our game sales these days to non-for-profit arts organizations. While we feel strongly about paying people who work on our projects, we unfortunately can't offer much. We're offering $0.10 per line for this production, with a minimum payment of $5 per acting part.


ACTING PARTS

If you're familiar with the classic adventure game genre and would like to help bring an interactive story to life, then we'd love to get to know you! It's a fun script and with a diverse range of parts, and we welcome the opportunity for actors to play multiple rolls. Here's what we've got:

 - A Christopher-Lee-esque villian
 - A Peter-Lorre-esque layer
 - Several parts for 40-70yo men, including an intellectual, an eccentric, and a man of mystery.
 - Several parts for 40-50yo fishermen and sailors.
 - International roles, including a female African, a male Spaniard, and a male Norwegian.
 - Several kid voices, including three snotty boys and a sweet young girl.
 - A male and female young adult (18-25yo) role.
 
The average part size is about 50 single-sentance dialog lines. There are a couple larger parts with 100-200 lines. Please see the following PDF with a complete listing of character summaries and their audition lines.


AUDITIONS & HIRING

We're offering $0.10 per transcript line for this production, with a minimum payment of $5 per acting part. Most parts have 25-75 lines; so a 25-line part would pay $5, while a 75-line part would pay $7.50. All payments will be made via PayPal, so you MUST have a PayPal account to receive payment. Multiple recorded takes still only count as single transcript lines. Payment will be made after an acting part has been recorded in full and delivered, and the recording quality and script accuracy has been verified. Recordings must be delivered with two-channel stereo, and saved in WAV format.

You're welcome to audition for any and all parts that you think you might be good at, please just record the audition lines and send a 192Kb MP3 file to gmacwill77 at gmail.com.
